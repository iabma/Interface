# Interface

Includes a text suggestor and a direct interface to the templates, facilitating the creation of clinical trial eligibility criteria. Made under HMS BCL (via MIT PRIMES).

To use, download the repository and navigate to either one of the html files. formatter.html will launch the template creator, and interface.html will launch the current prototype of the program user interface.
